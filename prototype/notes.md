Big Picture:
    domain name?
    website title?
    color scheme, layout

Technology Requirements:
    what languages/technologies will we be using? What database?
    Interaction between front and back end
    My initial thoughts for front-end: React, Redux, Webpack, Sass, client-side routing w/ react-router

Workflow/Collaboration:
    how does remote collaboration between developers get done/what tecthnologies do we need to collaborate?
    how to share code (github)?
    division of responsibility - front end, back end, etc.

Deployment

Alex word vomit

- tasks on a Trello board to easily keep track of who's working on what so don't duplicate working
- do work on separate Git branch, create a PR to master branch so that other person can review changes before merging to master if resources allow
- to discuss- is a backend is even needed for this project? at least for the MVP
- AWS website hosting from s3 bucket
- AWS Route53 for domain name
- I very much like the frontend tool stack you outlined- I also think we should consider using a React component library.  I REALLY like Material UI https://material-ui.com/
- for collab I think we can get most everything done through Google Hangouts and the occasional phone call/screenshare
