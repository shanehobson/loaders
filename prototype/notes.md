Big Picture:
    domain name?
    website title?
    color scheme, layout

Technology Requirements:
    what languages/technologies will we be using? What database?
    Interaction between front and back end
    My initial thoughts for front-end: React, Redux, Webpack, Sass, client-side routing w/ react-router

Workflow/Collaboration:
    how does remote collaboration between developers get done/what tecthnologies do we need to collaborate?
    how to share code (github)?
    division of responsibility - front end, back end, etc.

Deployment
